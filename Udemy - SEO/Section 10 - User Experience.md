## Bounce Rate
Bounce Rate is defined as the percentage of visitors that leave a webpage without taking an action, such as clicking on a link, filling out a form, or making a purchase.

## Why is bounce rate important?
Bounce Rate is important for 2 main reasons:
1. Someone that bounces from our site (obviously) didn't convert. So when we stop a visitor from bouncing, we can also increase our websites conversion rate.
2. A high Bounce Rate lets us know that our site (or specific pages on our site) has issues with content, user experience, page layout or copywriting.
