# What is Onpage SEO?
The algorithm can't always determine if your content is quality and exactly what your content is about.
So we need to structure the content correctly on our website.
- Onpage SEO (onsite SEO) refers to any change you make ON your website to improve its visibility.
- Examples:
	- Update the title tag on a page
	- Change the `<h1>` tag on a page
	- Edit the meta description of a page

# How to Optimize your website for the 3 kings

## Optimize the URL

Example: "yoga clothes"
Good URL : `website.com/yoga-clothes`
Bad URL : `website.com/yoga-clothes-tops-for-men-women-sale-cheap`

- Ideally go for shorter URLs.
- The bad URL looks very spammy.

**Pro tip:** Do not repeat words in the URL
Example: if your website is called `yoga.com`
Good URL : `yoga.com/clothes`
Bad URL : `yoga.com/yoga-clothes`

- If our pages already have decent rankings and has links pointing to the page we may want to avoid changing the URL.
- Changing the URL can result in a drop of rankings.

## Optimize the SEO title tag

 Its the main heading text that we see in the Google search results.
-  Get your keyword towards the front of the title tag.
- Write naturally.
- Try to include single words too.
- Don't repeat words.
- Keep it under 60 characters in length

The meta description is no longer a ranking signal.

## Optimize the page title

**Pro tip:** Don't make this the same as SEO title tag.
Mix up the words.
