# What are backlinks and how important are they?
 A backlink(link) is a mention of your website on an external website.
 Backlinks represent a "vote of confidence" from one site to another. In essence, backlinks to your website are a signal to Google that others vouch for your content.

# What is anchor text and why does it play a crucial part in your link 
Anchor text refers to the clickable words used to link one web page to another.

## Why are anchor text important?
SEO best practices dictate that anchor text should be relevant to the page you're linking to, rather that generic text.
Google can read this anchor text and they actually take into consideration when ranking a website.
For example if you link to a website with the anchor text "Blue Hat"
Google is going to assume that page has some relation to blue hats

## Different types of anchor text

There are 5 different types of anchors you can pick from when linking to another webpage.
Webpage Example -> `https://www.madesimplemedia.co.uk`
- Exact Match : web design agency
	- we reference the keyword we are targeting
	- avoid using them frequently
- Partial Match: design agency for your new business
	- This can be used in a sentence "Are you looking a design agency for your new business website?"
	- It only contains part of you keyword
	- much safe than exact match
- Brand: Made Simple Media
	- using your brand name as a anchor text
	- great for increasing brand presence
- URL : `https://www.madesimplemedia.co.uk`
	- use the naked URL as anchor text.
- Misc: Read more , click here
	- using generic text

## What anchor types does our website need?
There is no perfect ratio.
Its best practice to have a variation for them all.
Avoid exact match anchors if our domain name has the same keywords we are targeting.
Example: domain `yogamats.com` anchor text: yoga mats
This can be misinterpreted by Google

## What pages should you build backlinks to?

Build links to the pages you want to rank in Google.
For example:
- Homepage
- Blog posts
- Product pages

Don't just build links to your pages that have high buyer intent behind them as that looks extremely unnatural.
We want to blend in and not actively look like we're doing SEO

# Do-follow backlinks vs No-follow backlinks

## Do-follow backlinks
Format: `<a href="" />`
Do-follow links are links that count as points, pushing SEO link juice, and boosting the rank of that page.

## No-Follow Link
Format: `<a href="" rel="nofollow" />`
Links that are not count in point, and does not boost the page rank.

# A Theoretical Framework on Backlinks

A backlink should provide one of three things:
- Relevance
- Power
- Trust

## Relevance
Relevance is established from the content where the link is placed.

If you get a link from a website which is about golf, in an article which is about golf, then guess what? You're a little bit more about golf too

Relevancy will also come from the anchor text which is used.

## Trust
Links from certain "Seed sites" will increase a sites trust.
Speculation - Links from aged websites pass more trust

## Power
Links from bigger websites transfer more power.


# Link Building Strategies

## Strategy 1 - Guest Posting
Guest posting (or guest blogging) is when you write an article for someone else's blog.
It's a great way to connect with new readers and get your name out whilst also securing a link back to your website.
For example, if you own a healthy eating blog, then try and get a link from another healthy eating might be a little bit hard. However, what you can do is take one step back and guest post on a cooking website, as they would most likely have a section on their website for healthy eating recipes.
