Algorithms are complex systems Google uses to retrieve data from its search index and instantly deliver the best possible results for a query.

The search engine uses a combination of algorithms and numerous ranking signals to deliver webpages ranked by relevance on its search engine results pages (SERPs).
# Google Panda
Google Panda initial Release Date: February 23, 2011
The stated purpose of the Google Panda algorithm update was to reward high-quality websites in Google's organic search engine results.

## Panda Triggers
- Thin content
- Duplicate content
- Low-quality content
- Lack of authority/trustworthiness
- Low-quality user-generated content (UGC)
- Websites blocked by users
- Content mismatching search query

## How can I know if I've bee hit by Panda?
One signal of a potential Panda penalization is a sudden drop in your website's organic traffic or search engine rankings correlating with a known date of an algorithm update.

## How to Recover From Panda

# Google Penguin
Google Penguin Initial Release Date: April 24, 2012
The Penguin update was announced by Google as a new effort to reward high-quality websites and diminish the search engine results page (SERP) presence of websites that engaged in manipulative link schemes and keyword stuffing.

## Penguin Triggers
1. Link schemes
	It is basically the acquisition or purchase of back links from low quality or unrelated websites, creating an artificial picture of popularity.
2. Keyword Stuffing
	Populating a webpage with large number of keywords and constantly repeating in an attempt to manipulate the rankings for that webpage.

## How can I know if I've been hit by Penguin?
One signal of a potential penguin penalization is a sudden drop in your website's organic traffic or search engine rankings correlating with a known date of an algorithm update.

## How to recover from Penguin?
Avoid 
1. Link schemes (+ Disavow)
2. Keyword Stuffing

Google Staff - John Mueller called Penguin a site-wide algorithm.
Meaning that the presence of a large number of low-quality links pointing to one page of our website could result in a reduction of Google's trust in your entire website.


# Google Hummingbird
Google Hummingbird Estimated Release Date: August 20, 2013
Hummingbird has been cited as a complete overhaul of the core algorithm.

While it's believed that many preexisting components of the core algorithm remained intact, Hummingbird signaled Google's Commitment to an increasingly sophisticated understanding of the intent of searchers' queries with the goal of matching them to more relevant results.

It displays a knowledge graph using semantic search instead of giving 10 links.

## Semantic Search
Semantic search is the concept of improving search results by focusing on user intent and how the subject of a search relates to other information in a wider sense, or its contextual relevance.
Essentially, semantic search focuses on determining what a user really means, rather than a string of keywords, and then serving relevant results.

## Optimizing for Hummingbird
1. Diversify the Length of Your Content
2. Use Topic-Appropriate Language
3. Implement schema microdata
