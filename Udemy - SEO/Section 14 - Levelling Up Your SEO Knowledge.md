# Topical Relevancy
1. Keyword Research
2. Reviewing Your Competition

 To rank for competitive terms
 We need to prove to Google that your site is related to that topic and not just that specific keyword.
 Just because we have one page on our site about that keyword, it does not mean that our site is related to that wider topic.

## How may supporting pieces of content should I create?
1. Niche specific (Review your competitors)
2. Enough to cover the whole topic

## Tiered Link Building
A **tier 2 backlink** is a link linking to your backlinks.

Instead of links being calculated on a domain level basis, Penguin meant that they would calculate the power of individual pages that were linking to our website.

## What links do you build T2 links to ?
Tier 2 links are best built to pages that have a low page authority but a high domain authority.
I generally wouldn't build any Tier 2 links to links that are below `Moz` DA 25.
Essentially, the higher authority your link is, the more value you'll get out of each Tier 2 link.

## What link type should you use for T2's?
- Guest posts
- Niche edits

## How many T2 links should you use ? 
1-3 per page

## Does your tier 2 anchor text matter?
No. Google doesn't currently track relevance further than what is linking directly to your website.
